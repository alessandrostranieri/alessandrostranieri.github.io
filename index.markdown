Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Software Engineer, currently based in Milano, Italy (though still with a foot in Tartu, Estonia).

I developed and maintained back-end software for the travel industry and on-board software for public transportation industry. For most of my carreer I mainly worked in C++ on Linux systems, though I intermittedly stepped into the Java realm.

At the moment I work mainly in Go and develop software for performant cloud storage software. 

My favourite topics are clean code and best coding practices. I typically enjoy doing and receiving code reviews. I like simple and good looking code and I write my commit messages with the next developer in mind (that, of course, includes myself). 

In my free time I mostly work with Python and I am learning Rust, which is quickly becoming my favorite programming language.
I like to keep myself on top of things with [books](/books/) and [podcasts](/podcasts/).
