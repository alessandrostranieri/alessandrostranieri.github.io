Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Software Engineer, currently based in Tartu, Estonia.

I developed and maintained back-end for the travel industry and on board softwre for public transportation industry. In my carreer I mostly worked in C++ on Linux systems, I occasionally dwelled in the Java realm and lately I have been mostly working in Python. 
I am trying to follow closely the evolution of Rust, with which I occasionally cook some snippet.

My favourite topics are clean code and best coding practices. I typically enjoy doing and receiving code reviews. I consider this, together with pair programming, a great mean of professional and personal growth. I like simple and good looking code and I write my commit messages with the next developer in mind(that includes me).

I like to keep myself on top of things with [books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30001015-alessandro-stranieri?shelf=software-engineering-programming&utf8=%E2%9C%93&view=table) and [podcasts](/podcasts/).

At the moment, I am on a *work sabbatical* of sorts and I occupy my free time learning about Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning.
