Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Software Engineer based in Tartu(Estonia).

Throughout my career I have worked in different types of industries such as travel, public transportation and performant cloud storage. Since November 2021 I have been working on visualization software.

I have been mostly working in C++, with a rather brief break during which I have worked in Go. I have also occasionally helped out in Java.

My favourite topics are clean code and best coding practices. I typically enjoy doing and receiving code reviews. I like simple and good looking code and I write my commit messages with the next developer in mind (that, of course, includes myself). 

In my free time I mostly like to play with Python and Rust.
I like to keep myself on top of things with [books](/books/) and [podcasts](/podcasts/).
